**Steps To Reproduce The Issue**:Bildo and I did the DRG quest, everything works fine until the final fight. After we kill the NM last
he got DRG but I didn't. We went back and fought it again, everything normal until after the fight I got to pick the name, but after
exiting the hut DRG was not opened. I did it again solo, and picked a different name, it worked. Not sure which was causing the block.
Name that didn't work was Satavi, or something similar, name that worked was Azure.
